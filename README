==========================

- Pure POSIX c99
- Adheres to RFC 1459
- Configuration is done by editing config.h and recompiling
- Logs to stdout
- UNIX sockets only

Licensed under GPL v3+

Caveats:
You need to use a forwarding process to access the interwebs, allowing you to fine tune access
Currently only supports server <-> client

The hash table implementation currently uses FNV 1a, which can allow for hash-flooding
Eventually, sircd will use SipHash-2-4-64[1][2]
